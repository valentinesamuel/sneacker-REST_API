/**
 * Problem: fix Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{}'.
  No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{}' 

 * Solution: It looks like you are trying to access an object property using a string key, but the object does not have an index signature that allows this.

	To fix this error, you can either add an index signature to the object type or you can use a type assertion to tell the TypeScript compiler that you know what you are doing and that the access is safe.

	Note that using an index signature or a type assertion allows you to bypass the type checker and should be used with caution. It is usually better to define the object type explicitly, if possible.
